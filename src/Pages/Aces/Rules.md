This game is essentially poker/yahtzee. Aces, a 1, are wild. You get three shakes to get the best possible match. You don't play runs just 2, 3, 4, or 5 of a kind. You must roll an ace (1) to qualify, so if your first roll is five 6's, you're out of luck on that roll. You may take any dice aside that you wish, but you may not reroll them. Also aside from an ace if you take another point aside, say a 6, you must now score on that point. So for example if your first roll is 1-1-6-2-2 and you take your aces and the 6, and your next roll is 5-5, you may not take the 5's to improve your three 6's to four 5's.
