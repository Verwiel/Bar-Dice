In this game you roll as many times as it takes to finish. The goal of this game is to get the lowest score possible by farming 3's. A 3 is worth 0 points and the other dice are scored at face value. You roll and you can take aside as many 3's as you have rolled, and reroll all other dice. If you do not roll a 3 you must take one and only one die aside (the lowest available). You do this until all dice have been taken. Example game: First roll 3-3-5-2-6, I farm my 3's and roll the 5-2-6. Second roll comes out 2-5-4, no 3 so I take the 2, I now have 3-3-2 aside, with a score of two. Third roll 3-5, I take the 3. Fourth roll 6 (boo!). I end up with 3-3-3-2-6, a very beatable score of 8.
